      Museum and Memorial. As a collection holder, the museum had to permanently re-adpt
      the metadata schema it was using in the database to document its collection, as you
      can not describe a truck in the same manner one would create metadata for a photograhp
      for example. This illustrates how, based on the evolving nature of its collection,

    <h2>Flattening data</h2>
  	<ul>
  	<li>Data profiling and cleaning techniques are applied outside the information system itself</li>

    <h2>Interpretation of the title of a field</h2>
  	<ul>
  	<li>Seems simple to interpret in the context of our art catalogue but
  	this is not always the case</li>

  		<ul>
  			<li>What to expect from a field entitled <code>Sold</code>
          ? A binary yes/no, the name of the seller, the amount ?</li>

  	<li>Often unused columns are re-used without renaming them</li>
  	</ul>
  </div>

    <div class="slide" id="empty">
    <h2>Issues with Empty Columns</h2>
  	<ul>
  	<li>Appear everywhere, due to  a variety of reasons :
      <ul><li>Pre-configured settings
 	of databases resulting in a series of irrelevant columns which are never used</li>
 	<li>Data can loose their relevance and be deleted at some point, but the columns
    as such are rarely
 	removed from the system</li>

  <li>Fear of losing data prevents people from removing them, but

        <p>The iconic "Black Square" by Kazimir Malevich, of which he did a first
          version in 1905, is a good illustration of the complexity behind the representation
          and interpretation of the actual absence of something. Malevich himself said about
          the painting that "it is from zero, in zero, that the true
          movement of being begins". Across application domains, it has been demonstrated
          how difficult it is to document the absence of a value.

          <li>This issue mainly rises when you transfer data from a flat file to a database.</li>
          <!-- No, it tends to be the other way around. Moving from a well-structured database,
        with clear definitions of fields, to a flat file might result in packing together
      related but different (e.g. surname and family name) fields.   -->
          <li>Field overloading occurs when related (but different) data are put
          together in the same field, which lowers the possibilities to clearly define
        encoding constraints and structured search.</li>
          <!-- Yes, this answer clearly defines field overloading. -->

      <li> Why is it important to think about how we communicate about absent values ?

          <li>In order to save space.</li>
          <!-- No, this is not a relevant answer ! -->
          <li>An empty field can be there for a large variety of reasons. Knowing
          the reason can be important in order to know how to interpret the absence.</li>
          <!-- Yes! A value might not be known or not applicable, or there simply might
          not be enough resources to fill it in... -->
          <li>In order to avoid them at all times.</li>
          <!-- No ! Both for conceptual and operational reasons, it is impossible to avoid
        empty fields. The important aspect is to document the reason behind the absence
      of a value. -->
