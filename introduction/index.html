        <p>Red pandas are very cute animals, which are known to have a small
            home range. Where are we at as librarians? We have defined ourselves through
          a substantial body of cataloging rules and formats, developed and fine-tuned
          throughout the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Librarians across the globe have been repeating the
          <a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2002/10/ljarchives/marc-must-die/">
          <q>MARC must die</q></a> mantra for over a decade. In parallel, Linked Data have
          been heralded as the golden bullet to embed library metadata as native first-class
          citizens on the Web. However, when looking at <a href="https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/">
          BIBFRAME</a>, librarians often look like this anxious red panda…

          <p>The reaction is understandable. This fisher is holding up a Nile perch.
            The fish was artificially introduced in
            Lake Victoria and ended up eating all other fishes, wrecking the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_Nightmare">ecological balance</a>.

            Is Linked Data colonizing and corrupting our carefully curated library metadata?
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">
            <em>open-world assumption</em></a> underlying Linked Data and its radically decentralized
            architecture goes very much against traditional views on library metadata.

            <p>However, can library metadata and Linked Data join hands in a happy marriage,
              despite the apparent differences? These ten modules will help you
              as a librarian develop a more nuanced perspective
              on Linked Data by mastering some of the key methods and tools yourself!

<h2>Libraries and Linked Data…</h2>
<ul>
  <li>…share the same agenda
    <ul>
      <li>Making information available in an open and structured manner</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>…have different world views
    <ul>
      <li>Libraries have <em>boutique metadata</em>: carefully
        curated sets of cataloging records and controlled vocabularies</li>
      <li>Linked Data is based on the <em>open-world assumption</em> and embraces
        the opportunities offered by <em>big data</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating the different paradigms is challenging!</p>
</div>

<div class="slide" id="agenda">
<h2>Goal of these modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Librarians, be aware of IT fashion!
  <ul><li>Technologies come and go at a fast pace,
  librarians should be capable to go beyond the hype and understand what
fundamentally changes their profession</li></ul></li>
  <li>Clearly identify the <em>apples</em> and the <em>bananas</em>.
    <ul><li>Linked Data offers low-hanging fruits, bringing immediate
    gains at a relative small cost, but may also require heavy up-front
   investments in your library’s information architecture</li></ul></li>

<footer>Gartner introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a>
which demonstrates how technologies get over-hyped when they are introduced. It sometimes takes
5-10 years before the read added-value of the technology becomes apparent and leads to
operational advantages on the terrain. This Google Trends visualization helps
to understand how the popularity of terms such as the Semantic Web or Linked Data
peaks and lowers again.</footer>

      <p>A <em>Semantic</em> Web is no fantasy, it is already a part of our daily Web
      experience. Analyze for example the search results presented by Google
      based on the query “Drexel”.
      </p>
      <p>
      On the
      right from the traditional search results, you can see structured and semantically
      meaningful information. Notice here how we can
      identify the basic structure of the RDF data model: subject (Drexel), predicates (e.g. acceptance rate)
    and objects (e.g. 75%). This demonstrates how Linked Data is already
    very much a part of our day to day information consumption.</p>

 <footer>
   <p>As much as search engines already manage to embed Linked Data, libraries
     are still struggling to come to terms with it. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the
     Semantic Web and Linked Data from a research perspective, it is often hard to find practical examples which work.
   </p>
   <p>
     This video was published on YouTube in 2010, but it is still relevant.
     Despite promises from academics and consultants, we can not say that the Semantic
     Web or Linked Data have been a big success. One of the key purposes of these modules
     is to help you develop a more pragmatical view on what and what not to expect from Linked Data
     from the perspective of a librarian.

<p>Even if the road to integrate library catalogs within a <em>smarter</em> Web

  <blockquote class="long">
    <p>MARC has been an invaluable tool, but its card-based record-centric focus
    has also effectively locked our data in a tower and only those close aligned
    with the library profession have access to the key.</p>

    <h2>Progress with Linked Data in libraries

    <p>Important work on both the cataloging rules and the format has taken place
    over the last few years:</p>

      <li>Resource Description Access (RDA)
      <ul><li>New cataloging rules replacing AACR2</li></ul></li>
      <li>BIBFRAME

   abstraction, referred to as core classes: Work, Instance and Item.
   However, it is still very much a work in progress and the Library of Congress (LoC)

   with the conversion from MARC to BIBFRAME.</p></footer>
