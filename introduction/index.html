				Where are we at as librarians currently? We define ourselves through
        a substantial body of cataloging rules and formats, developed and fine-tuned over decades.
        The introduction of Linked Data within the library community
				offers enormous potential to publish metadata as first class citizens on the Web.
        However, there is still a lot of discomfort surrounding the usage of Linked Data
        in a library context...

					<p>The man on the picture is holding a Nile perch. This fish was artificially introduced in
            lake Victoria and ended up eating all other fishes and completely wrecked the ecological balance.
            Are Linked Data colonizing and corrupting the carefully curated library metadata ?
            Some of the conceptual and operational aspects of Linked Data seem exotic or even outright
            scandalous to a librarian.

						<p>Or can library metadata and Linked Data peacefully co-exist and leverage one

<h2>Libraries and Linked Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Share the same agenda
  <ul><li>making information available in an open and structured manner</li></ul></li>
  <li>Have different world-views
    <ul><li>Libraries have created <em>boutique metadata</em>: carefully
    curated sets of cataloging records and controlled vocabularies </li></ul>
    <ul><li>Linked Data are based on the <em>open-world assumption</em> and embrace
    the opportunities offered by <em>big data</em></li></ul></li>
  <li>Integrating the different paradigms is challenging !</li>
  </li>
</div>

<div class="slide" id="agenda">
<h2>Goal of these modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Librarians, be aware of IT fashion !
  <ul><li>Technologies come and go at a fast pace,
  librarians should be capable to go beyond the hype and understand what
fundamentally changes their profession and what not</li></ul></li>
  <li>Clearly identify the <em>apples</em> and the <em>bananas</em>
    <ul><li>Linked Data offer low-hanging fruits, bringing immediate
    gains at a relative small cost, but may also require heavy up-front
   investments in your library's information architecture</li></ul></li>

<footer>Gartner introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a>
which demonstrates how technologies get over-hyped when they are introduced. It sometimes takes
5-10 years before the read added-value of the technology becomes apparent and leads to
operational advantages on the terrain.</footer>

<div class="slide" id="picasso-query">
<h2>But wait... Why do we need a smarter Web ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Looking for information on Picasso ?
<ul><li>Easy! Type <code>Picasso</code> into a search engine</li></ul></li>
<li>Looking for paintings created by artists who were influenced by Picasso?
<ul><li>Hmmmm ...</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Both humans and machines need access to structured and <em>semantically meaningfull</em>
data on the Web</p>

      <p>A <em>semantic</em> Web is no fantasy, it is already a part of our daily Web
      experience. Analyze for example the search results based on the query "Drexel"
      from the right hand info box, where one can
			identify the basic structure of RDF: subject (Drexel), predicates (e.g. acceptance rate)
		and objects (e.g. 75%). This demonstrates how Linked Data are already
    very much a part of our day to day information consumption.</p>

<div class="slide" id="irony">
 <iframe class="cover width height" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0dEqgNKH0Y"></iframe>
 <footer>As much as search engines already manage to embed Linked Data, libraries
 are still strugling to come to terms with it. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the
 Semantic Web and Linked Data from a research perspective, it is often hard to find practicale examples which work.
 This video was published on Youtube in 2010, but it is still relevant.
 Despite promises from academics and consultants, we can not say that the Semantic
 Web has been a big success. One of the key purposes of these modules
is to help you develop a more pragmatical view on what and what not to expect from Linked Data
from the perspective as a librarian.</footer>

  <div class="slide" id="marc-quote">
<p>Even if the road towards the Semantic Web is difficult, it is no option
to just stick with our former practices and tools ... </p>
  <blockquote class="long">
    <p>MARC has been an invaluable tool, but its card-based record-centric focus
    has also effectively locked our data in a tower and only those close aligned
    with the library profession have acces to the key.</p>

  <div class="slide" id="bibframe">
    <h2>Progress with Linked Data in Catalogs
    </h2>
  	<p>Important work on both the cataloging rules and the format has taken place
    over the last few years :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resource Description Access (RDA)
      <ul><li>New cataloging rules replacing AACR2</li></ul></li>
      <li>Bibframe
        <ul><li>New container format to replace MARC and offering
        the possibility to embed Linked Data within a cataloging
        record</li></ul></li>
  </div>

  <div class="slide" id="irony">
   <iframe class="cover width height" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y673gCZ0ss"></iframe>
   <footer>Bibframe 2.0 was recently introduced and now features three levels of
   abstraction, referred to as core classes: Work, Instance and Item.
   However, it is still very much a work in progress and the Library of Congress
   is working hard on providing more information and help on how to go forwards
   with the conversion from MARC to BIBFRAME.</footer>

<div class="slide" id="job">
<h2>Will Linked Data help you find a job ? Yes !</h2>
<ul>
<li>Metadata cleaning
<ul><li>The transition process underlines the importance of cleaning up
inconsistencies in legacy metadata</li></ul></li>
<li>Issuing identifiers
<ul><li>BIBFRAME requires the creation for example of IDs for Works,
which libraries often do not have yet</li></ul></li>
<li>Reconciliation and enriching
<ul><li>Creating automated links with knowledge bases stands
high on the agenda</li></ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide" id="approach">

explain RDF and present the topic of data quality
</li></ul></li>
<li>Putting theory in practice
<ul><li>Three modules focus on concrete methods
and tools to clean, reconcile and enrich metadata</li></ul></li>
<li>Preparing for the future
