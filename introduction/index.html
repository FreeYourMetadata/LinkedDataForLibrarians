				As a community, where are we at as librarians currently at? Throughout the 20th century, librarians have
				embedded new technologies within their profession. The introduction of Linked Data within the library community
				offers enormous potential for sharing information in a more structured manner on the Web. However, some
				of the conceptual and operational aspects of Linked Data seem exotic or even outright scandalous to a librarian.
				These ten modules will allow you to better understand the possibilities and challenges

<h2>Libraries and Linked Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Share the same agenda
  <ul><li>making information available in an open and structured manner</li></ul></li>
  <li>Have different world-views
    <ul><li>Libraries create <em>boutique metadata</em>: carefully
    curated sets of high-quality cataloging records and controlled vocabularies </li></ul>
    <ul><li>Linked Data are based on the <em>open-world assumption</em> and embrace
    the opportunities offered by <em>big data</em></li></ul></li>
  <li>Integrating the different paradigms is challenging !</li>
  </li>
</div>

<div class="slide" id="agenda">
<h2>Goal of these modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Librarians, be aware of IT fashion !
  <ul><li>Technologies come and go at a fast pace,
  librarians should be capable to go beyond the hype and understand what
fundamentally changes their profession and what not</li></ul></li>
  <li>Clearly identify the <em>apples</em> and the <em>coconuts</em>
    <ul><li>Linked Data offer low-hanging fruits, bringing immediate
    gains at a relative small cost, but may also require heavy up-front
  investments which will not immediately pay off</li></ul></li>

<footer>Gartner introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a>
which demonstrates how technologies get over-hyped when they are introduced. It sometimes takes
5-10 years before the read added-value of the technology becomes apparent and leads to
operational advantages on the terrain.</footer>

<h2>Wait... Why do we need a smarter Web ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Looking for information on Picasso ?
<ul><li>Easy! Type <code>Picasso</code> into a search engine</li></ul></li>
<li>Looking for paintings created by artists who were influenced by Picasso?
<ul><li>Hmmmm ...</li></ul></li>

      <p>The intelligent Web is no fantasy, it is already a part of our daily Web
      experience. Analyse for example the search results from the right hand info box, where one can
			identify the basic structure of RDF: subject (Drexel), predicates (e.g. acceptance rate)
		and objects (e.g. 75%). Demonstrates how Linked Data are very much a part of our
	day to day information consumption.</p>

 <footer>As much as search engines already manage to embed Linked Data, libraries
 are still strugling to come to terms with it. Despite a tremendous enthusiasm for the
 Semantic Web and Linked Data, it is often hard to find practicale examples which work.
 This video was published on Youtube in 2010, but it is still relevant.
 Despite a lot of promises from academics and consultants, implementing the Semantic
 Web vision has not effectively taken place. One of the key purposes of these modules
is to help you develop a more pragmatical view on what and what not to expect from Linked Data
from the perspective as a librarian.</footer>

  <div class="slide" id="marc-quote">
<p>Even if the road towards the Semantic Web is difficult, it is no option
to just stick with our former practices and tools ... </p>
  <blockquote class="long">
    <p>MARC has been an invaluable tool, but its card-based record-centric focus
    has also effectively locked our data in a tower and only those close aligned
    with the library profession have acces to the key.</p>

    <h2>Progress with Linked Data in Catalogs
    </h2>
  	<p>Important work on both the cataloging rules and the format has taken place
    over the last few years :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resource Description Access (RDA)
      <ul><li>New cataloging rules replacing AACR2</li></ul></li>
      <li>Bibframe
        <ul><li>New container format to replace MARC. Bibframe 2.0 was
        published in April 2016</li></ul></li>
  </div>

  <div class="slide" id="irony">
   <iframe class="cover width height" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y673gCZ0ss"></iframe>
   <footer>Bibframe 2.0 was recently introduced and now features three levels of
   abstraction, referred to as core classes: Work, Instance and Item.
   However, it is still very much work in progress and the Library of Congress
   is working hard on providing more information and help on how to go forwards
   with the conversion from MARC to BIBFRAME. However, a lot of uncertainty and open-standing
   questions are outed internationally. </footer>
  </div>

<div class="slide" id="open-issues">
<h2>Incertainty and open-standing issues ...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bibframe
<ul><li>Data conversion programs and the vocabulary itself are very much
a work in progress</li></ul></li>
<li>ILS vendors and software
<ul><li>Not convinced of the implementation</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Both humans and machines need access to structured and <em>semantically meaningfull</em>
data on the Web</p>
</div>

<div class="slide" id="job">
<h2>Will Linked Data help you find a job ? Yes !</h2>

<ul>
<li>Metadata cleaning
<ul><li>The transition process underlines the importance of cleaning up
inconsistencies in cataloging metadata before </li></ul></li>

<li>Issuing identifiers
<ul><li>The Bibframe model requires the creation for example of IDs for Works,
which libraries often do not have</li></ul></li>

<li>Reconciliation and enriching
<ul><li>Creating automated links with Geonames for example stands
high on the agenda</li></ul></li>
