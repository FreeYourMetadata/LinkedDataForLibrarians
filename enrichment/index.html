      <p>In the previous module we saw how keywords can be linked to controlled vocabularies
				through reconciliation. However, this practice only works when someone already
				attached keywords to a resource. Large-scale digitization efforts are currently producing
				digital resources at a massive scale which do not have keywords attached to them. Traditional
				manual cataloging practices can’t keep up with this pace, so we have to think about how to use
				algorithms which can <em>gold mine</em> for semantics within non-structured texts.</p>

    <h2>Strategies for metadata creation</h2>
  	<p>The LIS community has to fundamentally rethink how to create added-value
			metadata in contexts where it is impossible to continue with a traditional

	<li>Wikipedia page about Jeff Koons?
		<ul>

<h2>Do URLs identify only electronic resources or also real-world objects?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Information resource
		<ul>
			<li>A Wikipedia article about Jeff Koons is clearly an information resource,
			as it can be represented in electronic form. Its URL can be used to identify,
		locate and acces an electronic representation of it</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Non-information resource
			<ul><li>We can represent a document <em>about</em> Jeff Koons, but this would be
			a different resource than the artist himself, as they have different properties (e.g.
			date of creation). The artist is therefore a non-information resource</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Koons">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Koons</a>

<p>When Jeff Koons is mentioned in the document,
the first URL will be used.

DBpedia is not able to represent Jeff Koons,
so it redirects you towards the page about Jeff Koons instead</p>

			HTTP Range-14</a> issue, in which the Web community debates on whether a URL
			should be understood as a reference to a document or a resource.
			Since one URL can only identify a single resource, a concept and its describing document(s)
			should necessarily have different identifiers.
			However, implementing this conceptual difference on the Web is difficult.
			The results sent back by NER services underline the semantic mine field we are still
			facing with this issue.
